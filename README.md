# Transport Network + Heapmap + Parallel Coordinates

#TRANSPORT NETWORK
Develop a graph which represents the public transport network of a city of your choice. Some cities have extensive public transport networks. In such case, represent minimum 3 lines with minimum 4 stations on each line. When visualising the network, use different colours for the different lines and their corresponding stations. Provide attributes to the edges which correspond to the distances between stations and visualise them. If the actual distances between the stations are not available, approximate them by using online map services. Visualise the names of the stations.

#HEATMAP
Find the average monthly temperatures of three cities of your choice. Represent the data by using a heat map. Provide a colour scale for guidance. Allow the user to specify a threshold for the heat map. Based on this threshold value, use different base colours when representing the data points.
